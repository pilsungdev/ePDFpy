# ePDFpy
ePDFpy is a python based open-source software for electron pair distribution function (PDF) analysis of amorphous materials to study their local structure. The software is a multi-platform and standalone program that can extract PDF from image file without any other program. ePDFpy enhanced center finding process and introduced elliptical error correction of image to get better quality of the intensity profile. These are all automated so it doesnâ€™t necessary require a user input. In addition, batch process help user analyze multiple files at once.
